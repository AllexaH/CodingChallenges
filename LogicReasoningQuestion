Question 3:
Turn 2 switches on
Wait for a while
Turn one off
Go to the other room
The lightbulb that is still on corresponds to the switch you left on
Check the other two to see which on is warm
The warm bulb corresponds to the switch you turned off before coming in
The cold bulb corresponds to the switch that was off the entire time
